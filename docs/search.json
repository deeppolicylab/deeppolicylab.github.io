    "section": "",
    "text": "Publication: One Earth\nDate: November 6, 2024\nPaper link\nPDF\nAs China progresses toward its 2060 carbon neutrality target, phasing out coal power remains critical to achieving substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, a new study highlights a significant hurdle in the nation’s green transition: less than 15% of China’s coal power plant workforce will find it easy to shift into green jobs.\n\n\n\nA coal power plant near Ordos, Inner Mongolia. Photo by Gang He\n\n\nThe study, published in One Earth, presents a comprehensive analysis of the geographic and skill-based challenges coal power workers face in transitioning to the renewable energy sector. A team of researchers from Peking University, CUNY Baruch College, and collaborators using a retirement model of 3,765 coal power units across China, the study reveals that for the majority of these workers, green jobs are not just around the corner—most would have to travel substantial distances, averaging between 178 and 242 kilometers, to reach available renewable energy job sites.\n\n\n\nLanhaiguang Solar Farm near Ordos, Inner Mongolia. Sourse: ST Daily\n\n\nBeyond location, the study also examines the skills gap. While green jobs—such as solar technician roles—are often cited as potential new employment opportunities, they generally require specific skills and training. When skill requirements are considered alongside job accessibility, the analysis shows that fewer than 15% of coal power plant workers can easily qualify for green roles.\nThe researchers emphasize that delaying the coal phaseout could make this job transition challenge even more daunting. However, they suggest a potential solution in expanding upstream industries within the renewable energy sector, such as electrical machinery manufacturing, which can be located closer to former coal sites and offer better skill alignment. Developing these industries near coal-dependent communities could ease the transition for a significant portion of the coal workforce, creating a more accessible and sustainable employment pathway.\nThe findings offer essential insights for policymakers. By understanding the spatial and skill barriers to green job transitions, the study can inform tailored strategies that support the coal workforce through retraining initiatives, targeted green job creation, and local investments in renewable industries.\nAbout the Study\nThe study, “Fewer than 15% of coal power plant workers in China can easily shift to green jobs by 2060”, was published in One Earth and provides a critical perspective on the coal-to-green job transition, highlighting the need for location-based strategies and skill development initiatives as China works toward a carbon-neutral future.\nCitation\n\nWu, Huihuang, Junfeng Liu, Xiurong Hu, Gang He, Yuhan Zhou, Xian Wang, Ying Liu, Jianmin Ma, and Shu Tao. 2024. “Fewer than 15% of Coal Power Plant Workers in China Can Easily Shift to Green Jobs by 2060.” One Earth, November. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2024.10.006."

    "title": "Exploring Energy Burden Among the Older Adults and People with Disabilities in New York City Public Housing Communities",
    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nThe goal of this proposal is to investigate the energy burden faced by older adults (ages 62 and older) and people with disabilities in New York City to better understand its impact on their well-being. Energy burden, characterized by more than 6% of household disposable income allocated to energy expenses, affects socio-economically vulnerable populations, particularly older adults and people with disabilities who often rely on fixed incomes from Social Security. These individuals are sensitive to temperature changes and thus to rising heating and cooling costs and tend to have heightened dependence on energy-consuming medical devices. Our mixed-methods approach involves selecting 10 public housing developments in NYC, facilitating targeted outreach to survey 100 individuals who are older adults and people with disabilities, receive social security benefits and diverse in race, ethnicity, and sex. We will then conduct in-depth interviews with 10 older adults and 10 people with disabilities from this surveyed group. Our quantitative analysis will offer a broad perspective, examining the impact of factors like inflation on energy burden, while the qualitative component will provide insights into lived experiences and coping strategies, particularly regarding expenses related to cooling and use of medical devices. The study will provide new insights and data for Social Security policymakers and researchers seeking to understand the energy needs and burden of older adults and people with disabilities living on fixed incomes. Our study of energy burden in NYC public housing communities directly speaks to the economic insecurities and service needs of low-income urban Social Security beneficiaries, a large, diverse, and traditionally underserved population. The findings will help identify beneficiaries likely to face energy burden and develop policies to assist them, thereby improving their well-being and the systemic equity in NYC and beyond.\nSource: NYRDRC Research Library 25-08"

Fifteen participants, including organizers and guests, joined in person, four participants joined via Zoom. Seven power system modeling teams, from both in the U.S. and China, presenting their modeling results. Dean David Ackerly of the College of Natural Resources welcomed the participants and highlighted the importance of the U.S. China collaboration. Professor Daniel Kammen joined the workshop by offering a remark on clean power transition in California and the U.S. during lunch time on July 19. The workshop created a platform for major power system modeling teams to introduce their models and share results. The participants also take focused sessions to discuss common challenges and emerging issues. The participants have good agreement to move forward on a few action items including a review paper and developing basic data transparency infrastructure."
