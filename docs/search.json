    "text": "Publication: One Earth\nDate: November 6, 2024\nPaper link\nPDF\nAs China progresses toward its 2060 carbon neutrality target, phasing out coal power remains critical to achieving substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, a new study highlights a significant hurdle in the nation’s green transition: less than 15% of China’s coal power plant workforce will find it easy to shift into green jobs.\n\n\n\nA coal power plant near Ordos, Inner Mongolia. Photo by Gang He\n\n\nThe study, published in One Earth, presents a comprehensive analysis of the geographic and skill-based challenges coal power workers face in transitioning to the renewable energy sector. A team of researchers from Peking University, CUNY Baruch College, and collaborators using a retirement model of 3,765 coal power units across China, the study reveals that for the majority of these workers, green jobs are not just around the corner—most would have to travel substantial distances, averaging between 178 and 242 kilometers, to reach available renewable energy job sites.\n\n\n\nLanhaiguang Solar Farm near Ordos, Inner Mongolia. Sourse: ST Daily\n\n\nBeyond location, the study also examines the skills gap. While green jobs—such as solar technician roles—are often cited as potential new employment opportunities, they generally require specific skills and training. When skill requirements are considered alongside job accessibility, the analysis shows that fewer than 15% of coal power plant workers can easily qualify for green roles.\nThe researchers emphasize that delaying the coal phaseout could make this job transition challenge even more daunting. However, they suggest a potential solution in expanding upstream industries within the renewable energy sector, such as electrical machinery manufacturing, which can be located closer to former coal sites and offer better skill alignment. Developing these industries near coal-dependent communities could ease the transition for a significant portion of the coal workforce, creating a more accessible and sustainable employment pathway.\nThe findings offer essential insights for policymakers. By understanding the spatial and skill barriers to green job transitions, the study can inform tailored strategies that support the coal workforce through retraining initiatives, targeted green job creation, and local investments in renewable industries.\nAbout the Study\nThe study, “Fewer than 15% of coal power plant workers in China can easily shift to green jobs by 2060”, was published in One Earth and provides a critical perspective on the coal-to-green job transition, highlighting the need for location-based strategies and skill development initiatives as China works toward a carbon-neutral future.\nCitation\n\nWu, Huihuang, Junfeng Liu, Xiurong Hu, Gang He, Yuhan Zhou, Xian Wang, Ying Liu, Jianmin Ma, and Shu Tao. 2024. “Fewer than 15% of Coal Power Plant Workers in China Can Easily Shift to Green Jobs by 2060.” One Earth, November. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2024.10.006."

    "text": "Release\nImported Solar Panels Deliver Major Climate and Health Benefits to the U.S., New Study Finds\nAs policymakers debate the future of clean energy supply chains, a new study published in One Earth reveals that imported solar panels have already delivered billions of dollars in public health and climate benefits to the United States.\nThe study, led by researchers from City University of New York (CUNY) and Stony Brook University, finds that solar panels imported into the U.S. between 2014 and 2022 displaced significant fossil fuel generation, avoided 178 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, and prevented an estimated 595 premature deaths linked to air pollution. These avoided impacts translate to $28 billion in monetized benefits—highlighting the far-reaching societal value of global clean energy trade.\n“Global supply chains have helped make solar power affordable,” said Dr. Gang He, project lead and associate professor at CUNY Baruch College and the Graduate Center. “But what’s often missed is how these imports also clean the air, protect health, and reduce climate damages. These are benefits that extend well beyond electricity prices.”\nThe researchers analyzed detailed shipment and power plant data across the U.S., using a reduced-complexity air quality model to track how solar energy displaced fossil fuels and improved air quality in different regions. They found that roughly 70% of solar electricity generated in recent years came from imported photovoltaic (PV) modules—mostly from countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand.\nKey findings include: During the study period between 2014 and 2022\n\n305 TWh of fossil fuel generation was displaced by imported solar PV\n178 million tons of CO2 emissions were reduced—11% of total U.S. power sector emissions in 2022\n595 premature deaths were avoided due to reductions in fine particulate pollution\n$28 billion was reaped in total monetized climate and health benefits\n\nNotably, the benefits were not confined to solar-importing states. “Over 40% of the air quality benefits flowed to people living outside the states that imported the panels,” said lead author Dr. Minghao Qiu, an assistant professor in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and the Program in Public Health at Stony Brook University. “That’s due to how electricity and air pollution move across state lines.”\n\n\n\nHoltsville Ecology Site Solar Farm, Photo by Gang He\n\n\nThe study also found that some regions benefited disproportionately. “The Carolinas, Texas, and parts of California saw especially high health and climate benefits because imported solar displaced power plants with high pollution burdens in densely populated areas,” said coauthor Dr. Peter Marcotullio, professor of geography at CUNY Hunter College and the Graduate Center. “This has real implications for regional planning and environmental justice—showing where clean energy investments can yield the greatest returns for human well-being.”\nThe study comes at a time when governments are reevaluating their reliance on foreign-made solar technology, citing concerns about energy security, geopolitics, and domestic job creation. The authors caution that shifting away from global supply chains without accounting for these broader societal benefits could slow clean energy deployment—and diminish its health and environmental gains.\n“Our research shows that imported solar panels do more than save money,” said He. “They save lives and reduce emissions. As we redesign energy and trade policies, we need to make sure we’re not leaving these benefits off the table.”\nThe study was supported by the Global Energy Initiative at ClimateWorks Foundation.

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nThe goal of this proposal is to investigate the energy burden faced by older adults (ages 62 and older) and people with disabilities in New York City to better understand its impact on their well-being. Energy burden, characterized by more than 6% of household disposable income allocated to energy expenses, affects socio-economically vulnerable populations, particularly older adults and people with disabilities who often rely on fixed incomes from Social Security. These individuals are sensitive to temperature changes and thus to rising heating and cooling costs and tend to have heightened dependence on energy-consuming medical devices. Our mixed-methods approach involves selecting 10 public housing developments in NYC, facilitating targeted outreach to survey 100 individuals who are older adults and people with disabilities, receive social security benefits and diverse in race, ethnicity, and sex. We will then conduct in-depth interviews with 10 older adults and 10 people with disabilities from this surveyed group. Our quantitative analysis will offer a broad perspective, examining the impact of factors like inflation on energy burden, while the qualitative component will provide insights into lived experiences and coping strategies, particularly regarding expenses related to cooling and use of medical devices. The study will provide new insights and data for Social Security policymakers and researchers seeking to understand the energy needs and burden of older adults and people with disabilities living on fixed incomes. Our study of energy burden in NYC public housing communities directly speaks to the economic insecurities and service needs of low-income urban Social Security beneficiaries, a large, diverse, and traditionally underserved population. The findings will help identify beneficiaries likely to face energy burden and develop policies to assist them, thereby improving their well-being and the systemic equity in NYC and beyond.\nSource: NYRDRC Research Library 25-08"

    "text": "Release\nNew Grant to Study the Drivers and Impacts of Domestic Clean Energy Manufacturing\nThe Deep Energy and Climate Policy Lab (Deep Policy Lab) is proud to introduce the “Made in America? Unpacking the Drivers and Impacts of Domestic Clean Energy Manufacturing,” a $750,000, three-year research project supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.\nIn recent years, the U.S. has made historic investments to rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity for clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, batteries, and associated supply chains. Yet policymakers and practitioners continue to face a fundamental challenge: the lack of an integrated analytic framework to assess how policies operating across different scales and sectors interact with trade, energy systems, climate outcomes, and local economic development.\nThis Sloan-funded project addresses that gap by combining empirical analysis, energy-systems modeling, trade and supply-chain analysis, and stakeholder engagement to generate policy-relevant insights on the effectiveness and consequences of domestic clean energy manufacturing strategies.\nInterdisciplinary and Cross Institutional Research Team\nThis project brings together an interdisciplinary team of experts, including Associate Professor Gang He, director of the Deep Energy and Climate Policy Lab, also a faculty member in Baruch College’s Marxe School of Public and International Affairs, the CUNY Graduate Center, and CUNY Institute for Demographic Research, will serve as Lead Principal Investigator.\nCo-PIs include Dr. Kaifang Luo, postdoctoral researcher at Baruch College, Associate Professor Michael Davidson from the University of California San Diego, Associate Professor Ahmad Lashkaripour from Indiana University, Assistant Professor Minghao Qiu from Stony Brook University, and Dr. Ilaria Mazzocco from Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\nThe project will collaborate with experts from the University of Maryland Center for Global Sustainability, New York Climate Exchange, University of California Berkeley, University of Dayton, and Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, with additional partners for local implementation and policy impact.\nThe research team’s expertise includes industrial policy, trade economics, energy systems, sustainability, and international supply chains. Each co-PI highlights the project’s unique contributions:\nGang He, Baruch College\n\n“This generous support from the Sloan Foundation enables us to take a rigorous, data-driven look at one of the most consequential industrial transformations underway in the United States. Understanding how domestic clean-energy manufacturing evolves, and who benefits, is essential for designing policies that support workers, communities, and a competitive low-carbon economy.”\n\nKaifang Luo, Baruch College\n\n“By coupling integrated assessment modeling with supply-chain analysis, we can better understand the technology evolution, cost trajectory, and decarbonization pathways associated with different combinations of industrial policies.”\n\nMichael Davidson, University of California San Diego\n\n“Federal incentives are reshaping the geography of clean-energy manufacturing at a scale we haven’t seen in decades. This project will help identify which policy strategies create durable industrial ecosystems, and which may struggle to take root.”\n\nAhmad Lashkaripour, Indiana University\n\n“Domestic manufacturing is deeply intertwined with global trade dynamics. By examining how U.S. policies interact with international supply chains, our work will shed light on trade implications that are critical for long-term competitiveness and economic resilience.”\n\nMinghao Qiu, Stony Brook University\n\n“Clean-energy supply chains have profound consequences for environmental sustainability and climate mitigation. Our analysis will quantify how different manufacturing pathways affect emissions, air quality, and broader environmental outcomes, insights that are essential for guiding responsible industrial transformation.”\n\nIlaria Mazzocco, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)\n\n“Effective industrial strategy requires more than data—it requires dialogue. This project will bring policymakers, industry leaders, and community stakeholders together through workshop and collaborative engagement to ensure that our research directly informs real-world decisions.”\n\nMore about the project can be found at: https://madeinamerica.netlify.app\nAbout Deep Energy and Climate Policy Lab\nThe Deep Energy and Climate Policy Lab aims to provide deep analysis and deep insights for deep decarbonization to address climate grand challenges.

    "text": "Release\nNuclear Renaissance? China’s Strategy Offers Lessons to Curb Soaring Construction Costs\nNew Nature Comment article shows how China’s energy policy and industrial approach have brought nuclear construction costs down, offering insights for global clean energy transition.\nJuly 28, 2025 — As countries race to scale up nuclear power to meet climate goals and power data centers, a longstanding problem persists: nuclear plants are notoriously expensive to build. But a new article in Nature Comment article reveals that China is reversing this global trend—offering lessons for how to rein in costs.\nIn the article, researchers from Harvard, CUNY, Stony Brook, and Johns Hopkins analyze newly compiled, plant-level data to show how China has managed to reduce nuclear construction costs over time. The authors credit China’s approach to a combination of standardized designs, strategic indigenization of components, and coordinated industrial policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChart shows that China has reined in the expenses associated with commercial nuclear units, while costs rose in the U.S. and France.1\n\n\n“Historically, in most countries, the more nuclear we build, the more expensive it gets, a phenomenon often called the nuclear cost curse,” said Shangwei Liu, lead author and researcher at the Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School. “China is the only country that has substantially expanded its nuclear fleet over the two past decades, but no comprehensive cost data was available. Here, we compile that data for the first time and find, somewhat surprisingly, that costs have been declining.”\nThe authors caution that nuclear power is still not “cheap,” but argue that China’s experience offers a valuable lessons for other countries aiming to deploy nuclear energy affordably and at scale. In particular, the article highlights the importance of coordinated regulation, staged indigenization of manufacturing, and long-term planning.\n“Substituting expensive imports with domestically produced components substantially lowered costs,” said Gang He, assistant professor at the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at CUNY Baruch College and Doctoral Faculty at the CUNY Graduate Center. “Strategic indigenization may be the key not only for nuclear, but also for other clean technologies in countries seeking to scale up rapidly.”\nThe authors also call on researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to avoid repeating past mistakes—such as abandoning standardized designs or rushing to localize complex systems before domestic capabilities are ready. They argue for deeper component-level cost analysis and greater alignment between safety and cost control in regulatory systems.\n“Countries that export nuclear technology should collaborate with importing ones,” said Minghao Qiu, assistant professor at Stony Brook University, “identify components that can be locally manufactured and train the workforce.”\nAs interest in small modular reactors (SMRs) grows and new nations enter the nuclear arena, the authors urge decision-makers to learn from both success stories and setbacks. “China shows that nuclear costs don’t have to rise with scale,” said Daniel Kammen, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Just Energy Transition at Johns Hopkins University. “But breaking the cost curse will take more than technology—it will take a smart and strategic approach.”"

In our original figure (now included as Supplementary Figure S1), we used the lower bound estimate of $4/W and denoted it as “&gt; $4/W” to reflect the uncertainty and acknowledge that this conservative value already illustrates the magnitude of cost escalation in France’s recent nuclear construction. Subsequently, the 2025 French Court of Auditors’ review placed the overnight construction cost at over $10/W. We note that the “&gt;” symbol was inadvertently omitted from the final published figure, and we apologize for this oversight. This figure has been updated to add a “~” symbol to Vogtle cost and a “&gt;” symbol to Flamanville 3 cost.↩︎"

Fifteen participants, including organizers and guests, joined in person, four participants joined via Zoom. Seven power system modeling teams, from both in the U.S. and China, presenting their modeling results. Dean David Ackerly of the College of Natural Resources welcomed the participants and highlighted the importance of the U.S. China collaboration. Professor Daniel Kammen joined the workshop by offering a remark on clean power transition in California and the U.S. during lunch time on July 19. The workshop created a platform for major power system modeling teams to introduce their models and share results. The participants also take focused sessions to discuss common challenges and emerging issues. The participants have good agreement to move forward on a few action items including a review paper and developing basic data transparency infrastructure."
