## Overview

The United States is the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It has great potential in clean energy manufacturing and transition, but its progress has been pushed back and forth between administrations and policies. This initiative aims to explore clean energy manufacturing and transition in the United States to achieve deep decarbonization, and to inform policies that support workers, communities, and a competitive low-carbon economy.
