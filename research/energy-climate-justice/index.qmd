## Overview

No one should be left behind in the transition to clean energy. This research theme studies the impacts of energy transitions on unemployment, energy burden, equity, and climate justice, focusing on the most vulnerable populations, e.g., low-income groups, disadvantaged communities, older adults, and people with disabilities.
