## Opportunities

We are always eager to work with committed researchers who are passionate about advancing interdisciplinary research in energy and climate.

### Collaboration and Funding Agency: 
We are actively seeking funding partners to support motivated students and interdisciplinary impactful [research](research.qmd).

### Prospective Graduate Students: 
We welcome highly motivated students with a strong interest in interdisciplinary energy and climate research to join our team. We have worked with [Marxe Assistants](https://marxe.baruch.cuny.edu/student-opportunities/employment-opportunities-at-marxe/current-marxe-assistantship-job-postings/) from the Marxe School MPA/MIA programs, [QMSS](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/quantitative-methods-social-sciences) program at the Graduate Center, and Ph.D. students from the [Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/earth-and-environmental-sciences) Program at the Graduate Center. 

### Undergraduate Students: 
We welcome motivated undergraduate students to get involved in our research projects. The [CUNY Climate Scholars](https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/climateaction/cuny-climate-scholars-fellowship/) Program is an excellent starting point for students looking to contribute to energy and climate research. 

### Visiting Ph.D. Students and Scholars: 
We are open to hosting motivated visiting Ph.D. students and scholars from around the world. To apply, please provide the following documents for consideration: 

- CV
- Research plan
- Language proficiency certificate (if applicable)
- One reference letter (if available)

We will provide a conditional invitation letter to support funding or scholarship application if research interest matches. An unofficial [paperwork guide](https://drganghe.github.io/notes/cuny-baruch-visiting-scholar-paperwork-guide.html) might be useful to learn the processes.
